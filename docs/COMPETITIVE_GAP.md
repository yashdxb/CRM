# Competitive Gap Review (Salesforce, Dynamics 365, HubSpot)

Goal: be “outstanding” vs market leaders without overbuilding. This is a pragmatic gap scan, not a full parity list.

Legend:
- STRONG: we meet/exceed typical baseline
- GAP: missing or partial vs competitors
- OPPORTUNITY: feasible differentiator in Next

## Core CRM Foundations

1) Lead management
- Status: STRONG
- Notes: lifecycle + conversion + assignment rules + auto score

2) Accounts/Contacts
- Status: STRONG
- Notes: CRUD + linking in place

3) Opportunities + pipeline
- Status: STRONG
- Notes: stages, probability, win/loss reason, history, pipeline view

4) Activities/tasks
- Status: PARTIAL
- Notes: CRUD and views exist, “My Tasks” + overdue UX not clearly proven

## Differentiation vs Market Leaders

1) AI scoring + next-best-action
- Status: GAP
- Notes: rule-based scoring exists, but no AI integration or recommendations
- Opportunity: small AI layer (scoring + risk alerts + suggested actions)

2) Email integration + timeline logging
- Status: GAP
- Notes: no send/sync/templates; competitors treat email as core

3) Calendar sync
- Status: GAP
- Notes: internal calendar view exists; no Google/Outlook sync

4) Reporting / dashboards
- Status: GAP
- Notes: one dashboard exists; no reporting module or exports

5) Data import/export
- Status: GAP
- Notes: UI route only; no real CSV workflow

6) Notifications + preferences
- Status: PARTIAL
- Notes: in-app toast exists; no notification center or email/push

## Enterprise Expectations (Don’t chase early)

1) Advanced permissions / field-level security
- Status: GAP (acceptable for Next)

2) Workflow automation / sequences
- Status: GAP (acceptable for Next)

3) Marketplace integrations (Slack, Teams, Zapier)
- Status: GAP (acceptable for Next)

4) Custom objects / schema builder
- Status: GAP (Later+)

## Recommended “Outstanding” Path (Realistic)

1) Ship AI‑assisted features early
- AI lead score + AI win probability + deal risk alerts
- Reason: clear differentiation vs HubSpot/Dynamics baseline

2) Make communications first‑class
- Email send + logging + templates
- Calendar sync for activities

3) Ship a lean reporting module
- 5 prebuilt reports with export

4) Nail onboarding + UX speed
- Fast setup, sample data, guided onboarding, command palette

## Winning Points (Competitive Edge Targets)

1) AI‑first workflow, not bolt‑on
- In‑record AI suggestions with rationale
- “Next best action” surfaced on accounts/opps

2) Communication‑native CRM
- Email + calendar act like a single timeline
- One‑click follow‑ups and auto‑logging

3) Zero‑friction onboarding
- 10‑minute setup with guided checklist
- Sample data + import wizard with preview

4) Performance + clarity
- Sub‑1s list loads for core tables
- Highly consistent UI across modules

## Summary

We are competitive on core CRM flows, but not “outstanding” vs Salesforce/Dynamics/HubSpot until AI, email/calendar, and reporting are shipped. Those are the highest‑impact gaps to close for Next.
