## Purpose

Ensure activities drive execution, not logging-only behavior.

## Required fields

1. Activity type must be selected.
2. Outcome must be recorded.
3. Next step subject and due date are required for active deal flow.

## Execution standards

1. Activity should be linked to lead, account, contact, or opportunity.
2. Follow-up actions should be clear and time-bound.
3. Activities without actionable outcome should be corrected promptly.

## Pipeline impact

1. Missing activity outcomes reduce forecast confidence.
2. Missing next steps create no-next-step risk signals.
3. Activity freshness affects at-risk deal detection.
