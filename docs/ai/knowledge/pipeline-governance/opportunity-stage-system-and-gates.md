## Purpose

Define stage progression governance so forecast quality reflects reality.

## Stage sequence

1. Qualification
2. Discovery
3. Solution Design
4. Demo or Validation
5. Proposal
6. Security or Legal
7. Negotiation
8. Commit
9. Closed Won or Closed Lost

## Exit gate requirements

1. Required fields for current stage must be complete.
2. Open next step with due date must exist before progression.
3. Stage movement is blocked when guardrail conditions are not met.
4. Forecast category must be valid for progressed and late stages.

## Risk and quality controls

1. Flag deals with no recent activity.
2. Flag deals with no next scheduled action.
3. Surface at-risk deals in command center and manager views.
4. Maintain stage history and audit events on every stage change.

## Close controls

1. Closed Won requires validated handoff readiness.
2. Closed Lost requires loss reason and supporting notes.
3. Close action must preserve win/loss analytics inputs.
