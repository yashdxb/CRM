## Purpose

Define execution standards that protect forecast quality and progression integrity.

## Core requirements

1. Opportunity must include owner, value, stage, and expected close date.
2. Every active opportunity requires a dated next step.
3. Stage progression requires stage-specific required fields.

## Forecast discipline

1. Forecast category must be maintained according to progression state.
2. Commit designation is allowed only for verified close confidence.
3. Stage or forecast overrides must be auditable.

## Risk controls

1. Opportunities with stale activity are marked at-risk.
2. Opportunities missing next step are marked execution-risk.
3. Manager review should prioritize late-stage at-risk deals.

## Close conditions

1. Closed Won requires handoff readiness and structured transition data.
2. Closed Lost requires reason capture for analytics and coaching.
