## Purpose

Define the standard sales execution path from new lead to closed opportunity.

## End-to-end flow

1. Capture lead with owner and source.
2. Start first-touch SLA and create first follow-up task.
3. Execute first outreach and log activity outcome.
4. Qualify lead using fit, authority, need, and timing signals.
5. Convert qualified lead into Account + Contact + Opportunity.
6. Set opportunity amount, close date, and initial stage.
7. Progress stages using enforced exit criteria and required fields.
8. Keep next step and due date present for every active deal.
9. Request approval when policy thresholds are exceeded.
10. Close as Won or Lost with required outcome fields.

## Non-negotiable hygiene

1. Every activity must include outcome and next step due date.
2. Active opportunities cannot progress without next-step discipline.
3. At-risk and idle deals must be addressed in daily workflow.

## Conversion outcomes

1. Conversion creates Account, Contact, and Opportunity in a single action.
2. Lead activities and notes are preserved for continuity.
3. Converted lead is closed to avoid duplicate work.

## Closed Won expectations

1. Complete handoff details for delivery.
2. Trigger onboarding tasks and ownership assignment.
3. Preserve full audit trail for stage changes and approvals.
