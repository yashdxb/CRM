## Purpose

Standardize KPI meaning for daily execution and coaching decisions.

## KPI definitions

1. Overdue: tasks or actions past due date.
2. Due Today: tasks scheduled for current day.
3. No Next Step: active opportunities with no future action scheduled.
4. At-Risk Deals: opportunities with stale activity or execution gaps.
5. Forecast Snapshot: current weighted view of pipeline by forecast category.
6. Pipeline by Stage: count and value grouped by opportunity stage.

## Usage guidance

1. Reps should clear Overdue and No Next Step items first.
2. Managers should review At-Risk and Commit-quality items daily.
3. KPI cards are execution signals and should map to immediate actions.

## Data quality notes

1. KPI reliability depends on timely stage and activity updates.
2. Missing outcomes or due dates reduce KPI decision quality.
