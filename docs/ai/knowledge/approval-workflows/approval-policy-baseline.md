## Purpose

Define when approvals are required and who can configure approval workflow.

## Baseline rules

1. Approval thresholds determine when manager review is required.
2. Multi-step approval chain is optional and configuration-driven.
3. All approval decisions must be auditable.

## Safety

1. Approval actions must enforce tenant isolation.
2. Role and security-level checks must be applied before action execution.
