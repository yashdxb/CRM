## Sales Rep (Full B2B Flow)

### Sales Home / Command Center
- As a Sales Rep, I want a daily command center showing tasks due/overdue, new leads, pipeline by stage, at‑risk deals, and my forecast snapshot so I can prioritize work immediately.
- As a Sales Rep, I want alerts for deals with no next step or no activity in X days so I can recover risk early.
- As a Sales Rep, I want quick actions (log activity, create task, schedule meeting) from the home view to reduce friction.

### Leads — Intake & Assignment
- As a Sales Rep, I want new leads automatically assigned with an SLA timer and first‑touch task so I never miss initial outreach.
- As a Sales Rep, I want the lead record to show source, score, and routing reason so I can tailor outreach.

### Leads — Qualification Loop
- As a Sales Rep, I want to log outcomes (Connected / Voicemail / No Response) and next steps so my pipeline is always up to date.
- As a Sales Rep, I want to qualify leads by company fit, authority, need, and timing so only real opportunities move forward.
- As a Sales Rep, I want lead outcomes enforced (Disqualified reason, Nurture follow‑up date, Qualified notes) to keep data clean.

### Lead Conversion
- As a Sales Rep, I want a single conversion action that creates Account + Contact + Opportunity and transfers activities/notes.
- As a Sales Rep, I want the lead to close automatically after conversion to avoid duplicate work.

### Accounts & Contacts

- As a Sales Rep, I want to add account team members (pre‑sales, manager) for shared ownership.

### Opportunities — Setup
- As a Sales Rep, I want to set opportunity name, value, close date, and initial stage so the deal is trackable from day one.
- As a Sales Rep, I want forecast category enforced at stage changes so forecasts stay accurate.

### Opportunity Stages — Execution
- As a Sales Rep, I want stage‑specific exit criteria (required fields, next step) so stage progression reflects reality.
- As a Sales Rep, I want stage‑specific activity templates so I can log actions faster.

### Qualification Stage
- As a Sales Rep, I want to confirm pain, decision maker, and next step before advancing.
- As a Sales Rep, I want to schedule discovery and log notes before leaving the stage.

### Discovery Stage
- As a Sales Rep, I want to capture requirements, buying process, and success criteria to qualify fit.
- As a Sales Rep, I want a structured checklist to flag risks early.

### Solution Design Stage
- As a Sales Rep, I want to involve pre‑sales and document scope/approach for alignment.
- As a Sales Rep, I want to track technical risks before demo/validation.

### Demo / Validation Stage
- As a Sales Rep, I want to capture demo outcomes and feedback; stage progression should require a demo outcome.

### Proposal Stage
- As a Sales Rep, I want to generate a quote/proposal, request discounts if needed, and track legal/security needs.

### Security / Legal Review
- As a Sales Rep, I want to track security questionnaire and legal redlines with status updates.

### Negotiation Stage
- As a Sales Rep, I want to finalize pricing, record objections, and update probability/close date with approvals if thresholds are exceeded.

### Commit Stage
- As a Sales Rep, I want to mark deals as Commit only when verified and expected to close.

### Closed Won
- As a Sales Rep, I want the system to create onboarding tasks, assign delivery/CS, set renewal date, and lock the deal.
- As a Sales Rep, I want to provide handoff notes and trigger a kickoff.

### Closed Lost
- As a Sales Rep, I want to record loss reason, competitor, and notes so leadership can analyze trends.

### Daily Activity Discipline
- As a Sales Rep, I want every activity to require an outcome and a next step with due date, ensuring pipeline hygiene.
- As a Sales Rep, I want the system to surface opportunities missing next steps.

### Manager Interactions
- As a Sales Rep, I want to submit pricing/discount approvals and see status + manager feedback.
- As a Sales Rep, I want review outcomes (Needs Work / Escalate) to create acknowledgment tasks with due dates.

### Renewals
- As a Sales Rep, I want renewal opportunities auto‑created at 90/60/30 days so renewal motions are never missed.

### Guiding Principle
